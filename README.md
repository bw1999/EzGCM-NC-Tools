Welcome to EzGCM-NC-Tools

This repository is built to provide better Matlab interfacing with .nc (NetCDF) files that are outputs of the EzGCM online tool.

Get started by running init_path.m and check out the examples/ directory for starter scripts.

Slated for future development:
* Reading in many .nc files and aggregating
* Plotting examples using matlab CDT/ repository
* Slicing and aggregation of .nc data by time and region
